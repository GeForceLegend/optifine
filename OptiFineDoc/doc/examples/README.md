## Random Entity Textures

This resource pack showcases OptiFineâ€™s Random Entity Textures feature, allowing entities to have different textures based on various conditions such as custom names or weighted randomness.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Features</strong></summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Cows use the default behaviour. With no properties file, they will show all the provided textures randomly</li>
    <li>Chickens receive unique textures based on their names. If no name is present, it will fall back to weighted randomness.</li>
    <li>Slimes have a unique texture in the jungle, bamboo jungle, and ocean biome. The texture also has a 10% chance to show up in a swamp biome.</li>
    <li>Endermen use NBT checks to change texture based on the block they are holding. When holding a grass block, they will change texture.</li>
  </ul>
